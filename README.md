## Our Project
This GitHub repo contains the following: <br>
* **Prototype Code**
    * We've included code (mostly in HTML / CSS / JavaScript) for the landing page, recommendation and browse features, and the measurements, try-on, and ratings screens.
* **3D Model Images**
    * We've included snapshots of 3D models that are generated by a combination of outputs from the Body Visualizer API and additional code that is specific to the unique "personalization" that Pick Me offers.  
* **Slide Decks** 
    * We've outlined the startup idea and the overall technical design + architecture of the platform.
